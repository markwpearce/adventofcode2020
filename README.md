# Advent Of Code 2020

Puzzle solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/)

As an exercise of self-punishment, this was done in Roku's [Brightscript](https://developer.roku.com/en-ca/docs/references/brightscript/language/brightscript-language-reference.md) language.

Well, actually, it is in [Brighterscript](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript), so I can do stuff like imports and classes.

1. Install

```
npm run install
```

2. Run Puzzle

Run a puzzle solution from the src/source directory:

```
npm run file -- --puzzle=<filename> --input=<inputfile>
```

eg.

```
npm run file  -- --puzzle=day1 --input=input/1-1-test
```
